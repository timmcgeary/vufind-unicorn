# Introduction #

Hello, and welcome to the VuFind-Unicorn project Wiki.  Most of the documentation can currently be found in the source.  The Downloads tab should generally have a reasonably up-to-date tarball of the project, but since it is only a handful of files, it is probably best to download as needed from the Source tab.


# Details #

In general, to read and download files, try the 'Browse' function of the Source tab:
http://code.google.com/p/vufind-unicorn/source/browse/

You can see the README.txt file here:

It is also handy for downloading individual files to use the 'View raw file' link on the right-hand side of each browse view page.
